             <br><p>Being environmentally aware means understanding how our behaviour impacts the environment and committing to making changes to our activities to protect the planet. The environmentalist movement in recent decades has prompted many people to make both minor and substantial lifestyle changes to live in a more environmentally friendly way.</p>
             <p>Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences of these human decisions and help the planet's health take a complete 180 degree in the other direction.

These activities can lead to environmental degradation, resulting in serious consequences for humans and the environment, such as climate change, habitat loss, and resource depletion. It is for this reason that environmental awareness is so important.</p>
            <p>Environmental awareness is important because our earth provides resources that are essential to our well-being and quality of life. These resources include clean air, water, and soil, as well as a wide range of plants and animals that contribute to the richness and diversity of our planet.

            <br><br><br><p>This issue is one that causes a great deal of environmental destruction. Our dependence on fossil fuel is a global addiction that affects every aspect of the world. Oil spills and offshore drilling poison marine life, oil drilling (on land) suffocates the Earth, and the combustion of fossil fuels add to the increased atmospheric CO₂, which in turns causes the progression of global warming and ocean acidification. This is a multifaceted issue and is a good cause to get involved with because it covers such a broad spectrum of issues.

            <br><br><h4>POLLUTION</h4><br><br>
            <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment, which can be natural or created by human activity. It can damage the quality of air, water, and land, and is a global problem. Pollution can spread to remote places where no people live, such as the Antarctic ice sheet and the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Air and water currents carry pollution, and ocean currents and migrating fish carry marine pollutants far and wide. Winds can pick up radioactive material accidentally released from a nuclear reactor and scatter it around the world. In the past, visitors to Big Bend National Park in the U.S. state of Texas could see 290 kilometers (180 miles) across the vast landscape, but now, coal-burning power plants in Texas and the neighboring state of Chihuahua, Mexico have spewed so much pollution into the air that visitors can sometimes see only 50 kilometers (30 miles).

            <h4>CLIMATE CHANGE</h4>
            <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.</p>
            <p>Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
              The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases. <a id="link1" href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change">United Nations</a></p>

            <br><br><br><h4>WASTE MANAGEMENT OR WASTE DISPOSAL</h4><br><br><br>
            <p>Waste disposal means removing, discarding, recycling or destroying unwanted materials called waste that is produced from agriculture, domestic usage or industrial products. Following the correct methods for waste disposal will ensure lesser pollution and hazards for the environment. Proper waste management is necessary with steps involving the proper collection of waste and scientific treatments that may contribute less to water pollution, soil pollution and air pollution. <a id="link1" href="https://www.vedantu.com/biology/waste-disposal">VEDANTU</a></p>

          <h4>BIODIVERSITY LOSS</h4>
          <p>Biological diversity is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and bacteria to entire ecosystems such as forests or coral reefs. The biodiversity we see today is the result of 4.5 billion years of evolution, increasingly influenced by humans.

            Biodiversity forms the web of life that we depend on for so many things – food, water, medicine, a stable climate, economic growth, among others. Over half of global GDP is dependent on nature. More than 1 billion people rely on forests for their livelihoods. And land and the ocean absorb more than half of all carbon emissions. 
            
            But nature is in crisis. Up to one million species are threatened with extinction, many within decades. Irreplaceable ecosystems like parts of the Amazon rainforest are turning from carbon sinks into carbon sources due to deforestation. And 85 per cent of wetlands, such as salt marshes and mangrove swamps which absorb large amounts of carbon, have disappeared.

          <h4>DEFORESTATION</h4>
          <br><p>Deforestation is the deliberate clearing of forested land for agriculture, animal grazing, and wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction. It has greatly altered landscapes around the world, with 80% of Western Europe being forested and 34% in North America. China has lost great expanses of its forests over the past 4,000 years and now just over 20% of it is forested. The greatest amount of deforestation is occurring in tropical rainforests, aided by extensive road construction and slash-and-burn agriculture. Deforestation can result in more carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere, as trees take in carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis.
            It also threatens the world’s biodiversity, as it can drive many of those species into extinction and leave soil more prone to erosion. While deforestation can be permanent, it is not always the case. In North America, for example, forests in many areas are returning thanks to conservation efforts.

          <br><br><h4>HABITAT LOSS</h4>
          <br><p>Habitat loss refers to the reduction in the amount of space where a particular species, or group of species can survive and reproduce.  Habitat loss is a consequence of human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, deforestation, resource extraction, alteration of the sea-floor due to trawling (fishing), or the release of pollutants. Habitat loss can also occur due to environmental changes, such as volcanic eruptions or tsunamis, or changes in climate or sea level, which today are largely the result of human activities.  Habitat loss can decrease biodiversity and alters species ranges and interactions.

            <br><h4>FOOD WASTE</h4>
            <br><p>Food loss and waste is food that is not eaten. The causes of food waste or loss are numerous and occur throughout the food system, during production, processing, distribution, retail and food service sales, and consumption. Overall, about one-third of the world's food is thrown away. A 2021 meta-analysis that did not include food lost during production, by the United Nations Environment Programme found that food waste was a challenge in all countries at all levels of economic development. The analysis estimated that global food waste was 931 million tonnes of food waste (about 121 kg per capita) across three sectors: 61 percent from households, 26 percent from food service and 13 percent from retail.
